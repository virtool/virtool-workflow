        Since Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain insertion order.
        A side effect of this is that a module's __dict__ attribute
        maintains **definition** order, since attributes are added to
        the dict as they are defined. This is also the case in python 3.6,
        however it is an implementation detail and not a PEP specification.

        This function may not work as intended in older versions of python.
